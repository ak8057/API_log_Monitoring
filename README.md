# 🛡️ AI-Powered API Monitoring & Anomaly Detection System

<h2 id="index">📖 Index</h2>

> 🚀 Developed by Team VCHAMPS | Finalists at Barclays Hack-O-Hire 2025 (Generative AI Track)

## 📌 Problem Statement
APIs are the backbone of modern digital platforms. However, failures, security issues, and performance degradation due to poor monitoring can lead to serious consequences including:
- Downtime and financial loss
- Delayed incident response
- Inefficient debugging
- Missed security breaches

## 💡 Our Solution
An AI-driven, scalable monitoring and anomaly detection system for large-scale distributed platforms that:
- Monitors API behavior in real-time
- Detects anomalies using ML (Isolation Forest, LSTM, Autoencoders)
- Automates alerting and response
- Visualizes insights using ELK stack & Grafana

## 🧠 Key Features
- ✅ Real-Time Log Monitoring
- 🔍 ML-Based Anomaly Detection
- 📊 Interactive Dashboards (Kibana, Grafana)
- 📬 Automated Alerts (Email/Slack/Prometheus)
- 🔁 Continuous Learning with Feedback Loop

## 🧰 Tech Stack

### 🗂 Log Collection & Processing
- **Filebeat, Logstash, Kafka** for ingestion
- **Elasticsearch** for storage
- **MongoDB** for structured logging

### 📈 Visualization & Monitoring
- **Kibana**.

### 🤖 Machine Learning
- **Isolation Forest, LSTM, Autoencoders**
- **TensorFlow**, **scikit-learn**


## 🔧 Architecture Overview

1. **Log Generation & Collection**  
   → Flask / Node.js apps log data via Filebeat

2. **Log Storage & Preprocessing**  
   → Processed through Logstash → Indexed in Elasticsearch

3. **ML Feature Extraction & Anomaly Detection**  
   → Structured logs converted to datasets  
   → Detected via ML models (Isolation Forest, LSTM, BERT for unknown logs)

4. **Real-Time Monitoring & Alerting**    
   → Dashboards via Kibana.
